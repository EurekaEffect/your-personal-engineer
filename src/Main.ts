// I'm going to redo everything I did before using TypeScript to make the code more readable.
// TS will compile every .ts file into a JS bundle (ype.bundle.user.js).
// I will use it because I don't know how to divide a one single JS file into multiple files and make it work in TamperMonkey.
// BTW even if I knew I'd use TS since it's way cooler than JS :sunglasses:.

console.log('Main.ts')
