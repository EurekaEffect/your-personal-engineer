### Your Personal Engineer

This is a browser extension that includes automation for tasks previously performed by traders, as well as displays additional information on [backpack.tf](https://backpack.tf) (support for [next.backpack.tf](https://next.backpack.tf) is not planned).

### Disclaimer

WIP! This browser extension is under a maintenance.<br>
This means that the script is still in development and is not intended for daily use. It lacks most of the functionality and may cause errors.

### TODO

- **One-Click Offer**
    - Add buttons for turning on/off avoidance of the same items and double check
    - Avoid reusing the same items
    - Round metal from 0.05 to 0.11

- **Trade Offer History** - allows you to view your trade offers from all time.
- **Cost to craft** - shows the fabricator's cost to craft.
- **Spell icons** - shows the attached spells on the item.
